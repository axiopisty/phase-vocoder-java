A phase vocoder is a DSP technique used to speed up or slow down the playback speed of music without altering its pitch.\r\n\r\n## Goal\r\n\r\nThe long-term goal of this project is to build a high-performance, easily-used Java library for real-time tempo modification of live music.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nThis project is at a very early stage in development, but if it succeeds in getting off the ground, I'd be welcome some help expanding it.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
